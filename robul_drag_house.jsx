const README_TEXT = `Robiul Drug House Web App

This project is a Vercel-ready React web app for managing pharmacy sales.

Project files (place in a folder named "robiul-drug-house"):
- index.html                : HTML entry point
- index.jsx                 : React app entry (mounts the main component)
- RobiulDrugHouseApp.jsx    : Main app component with sales, charts, CSV export, and printing
- VoucherPrint.jsx          : Separate component for voucher printing
- ReportPrint.jsx           : Component for A4 / POS report printing
- index.css                 : Dark mode theme and app styles
- package.json              : Node.js project configuration and scripts
- vite.config.js            : Vite config for React project
- README.md                 : This README (you can use the text below)

Quick local run (using Vite):
1) Ensure you have Node.js (>= 14) and npm installed.
2) In the project folder, run:
   npm install
   npm run dev
3) Open the local URL shown by Vite (for example http://localhost:5173).

To deploy publicly (Vercel recommended):
1) Create a GitHub repository and push the project files to it.
2) Go to https://vercel.com and import your GitHub repository.
3) Use the default build settings (Vite) and deploy. Vercel will give you a public URL.

Important note about the SyntaxError you saw:
- Do NOT include box-drawing or other special non-ASCII characters directly inside
  JavaScript or JSX source code. Characters like '├' and '─' are not valid syntax and
  will break the parser. Use plain ASCII for comments or include directory listings
  inside README.md as simple text (no box-drawing characters).

If you want, I can:
- Create the full project as a downloadable ZIP with all source files ready to run.
- Generate a GitHub-ready repository structure and a step-by-step deploy guide.
- Provide the exact RobiulDrugHouseApp.jsx, VoucherPrint.jsx, ReportPrint.jsx, index.jsx,
  index.html, index.css, package.json, and vite.config.js files.

Tell me which option you prefer and I will produce the files.
